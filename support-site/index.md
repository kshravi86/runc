# Run-C — Support

Welcome to the official support page for Run-C, an educational iOS app that lets you write, highlight, and execute small C programs entirely offline. Ideal for learning, tinkering, or quick experiments on the go.

If you need help, email us at: [kshravi86@gmail.com](mailto:kshravi86@gmail.com)

## Overview
- Offline C execution with simple examples
- Syntax highlighting and basic error surfacing
- Fast feedback with output and warnings
- No internet required to run code

## Quick Start
1. Open Run-C on your iPhone or iPad.
2. Type a small C program (e.g. a `main` that prints output).
3. Tap Run to execute; results and warnings appear below the editor.

## Report a Bug / Request a Feature
- Email: [kshravi86@gmail.com](mailto:kshravi86@gmail.com)
- When reporting, please include:
  - iOS version and device model
  - Steps to reproduce

## FAQ
**Does Run-C need internet?**  
No. Compilation and execution are performed locally in the app.

**What C features are supported?**  
Run-C focuses on core language constructs for learning (control flow, numbers, strings, basic I/O). Some advanced features and system APIs are intentionally not supported on iOS.

**Where are my files stored?**  
Your code stays on your device unless you share or export it.
