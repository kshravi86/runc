# Privacy Policy

Last updated: {{ site.time | date: "%Y-%m-%d" }}

This Privacy Policy describes how the Run‑C iOS app (the “App”) handles information. We designed Run‑C to work fully offline so you can write and run C programs on your device without sending data to servers.

## What We Collect
- We do not collect, store, or sell personal information.
- The App does not use third‑party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
- Your code, program output, and settings remain on your device unless you choose to share them (for example, by copying, exporting, or emailing).

## Network Access
- Running code does not require an internet connection.
- Any network activity only occurs if you explicitly initiate it (e.g., opening an email draft to contact support).

## Crash and Diagnostic Data
- We do not collect diagnostics within the App. If you enable Apple’s system‑level “Share With App Developers” settings, Apple may share anonymized crash logs with us. These logs, if received, do not include personal data and are used only to improve stability.

## Children’s Privacy
Run‑C is a general‑audience app and can be used for education. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. Because the App does not collect data, there is nothing to delete or export.

## Data Retention
- User content (your code and outputs) is stored locally on your device and under your control.
- Uninstalling the App removes locally stored data.

## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect product or legal changes. Updates will be posted at this page with a revised “Last updated” date. Material changes will apply going forward.
